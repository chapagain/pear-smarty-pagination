Blog Article: [Pagination in PEAR and Smarty](http://blog.chapagain.com.np/pagination-in-pear-and-smarty/)

#### Note on Smarty

Smarty library files are not included here.

You need to download Smarty library files from http://www.smarty.net/download

Extract the file and rename the extracted folder as `smarty`

Copy the folder `smarty` in your working directory.

The directory structure should be as follows:

	my-folder (your working directory)

		-- classes (this contains class files)

		-- smarty (this is the Smarty library files directory)

		-- smarty_temp
