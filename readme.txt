You need to download Smarty library files from http://smarty.php.net/download.php 
OR directly from http://chapagain.googlecode.com/files/smarty.zip

Then extract the file and rename the extracted folder as 'smarty'

Then copy the folder 'smarty' in your working directory present inside the root folder of your web server. (At present, this is your working directory. So, you must copy the 'smarty' folder in this directory.)

The directory structure should be as follows:

example (your working directory)
   -- classes (this contains class files)
   -- smarty (this is the Smarty library files directory)
   -- smarty_temp
